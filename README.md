Study On Weight of Chicks on Different Diets

Project Link:http://rpubs.com/surabhik16/study_on_chick_weights

Over the recent years, the poultry industry is growing rapidly and so is the demand. To get the full potential out of broiler chickens it is important that the target weight at 7 days of age should be reached.These days the interest in early nutrition research has increased due to the high correlation between the weight and the diet given during the initial stage.

In this project we aim to find out if the different protein diets have different effects on the weights of the chicks.

Topic covered in this project :

1. Empirical CDF

2. Bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals

3. MLE and its asymptotic distributions

4. Hypothesis Testing

5. Wald Test

6. Bayesian analysis
